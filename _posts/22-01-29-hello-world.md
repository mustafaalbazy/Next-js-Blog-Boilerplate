Hi everyone, 

This is my first post in the newly created personal site. 

I'm still in the early stages of the site development. So expect some changes in the coming weeks. However, I'll keep the design minimal as much as I can, as I hate busy-looking sites specially when it is about reading text such as blogs and articles. 

### Comment Section

Unfortunately, for now there'll be no comment section. I may add something like *Discus* or *Facebook* comments API. Still not sure for now, will see.

### Markdown Editing

But the best thing I've accomplished for now is the usage of Markdown syntax for my pages/blogs instead of pure html/css codes within the text. Thanks to **Next.Js**

Markdown is always fun to write with, specially technical writing. Here is an example code block:

```js
function myFunction() {
  return true;
}
```



### Why not Wordpress

I love Wordpress and I've been using it since 2007, that's 15 years!

But this time I want to try something different, and a newer technology or site design philosophy. So I went with the current trend of Static-Site-Generators. 

It's fun and you'll learn a lot of JavaScript and sharpening your HTML/CSS skills as well. Plus, as everything is completely static so that makes the loading time extremely fast. Nothing to hate here.

So, that's about everything for now.

Take care .. Mustafa :)
